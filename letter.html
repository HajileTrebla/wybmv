            Dear Ace,
        </p>

        <p>
            I originally wanted to give this to you along with the delivered flowers,
            but di nga mabait satin mundo. I wanted it to be special. So I decided to place it here instead.
            I wanted to send this specific bouquet sana.
        </p>

        <p>
            Happy Valentine's Day Ace, Ever since the day we reconnected last year up to today, You had made each day brighter.
            You have given me so much this past year and I cherish each and every memory.
            So here is a little reminder of how much I love you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope you like this as much as you would have if I could have real flowers delivered to you.
            I wish I could be there to give you a real bouquet and a real hug, but for now, this will have to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love you so much Ace
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold text-rose-600">
            With all my heart, 
            Yours 💖
        </p>
